      <section>

	<p><strong>I'm a computer scientist and practitioner
	interested in programming languages and algorithms, with a
	diverse software engineering experience.
	</strong></p>

	<p>I enjoy developing practical yet minimalistic tools and
	libraries, as well as developing theoretical frameworks to
	  elegantly solve problems with less-than-ideal solutions.
	  </p>

	<p>
	  Optimization is what I am constantly striving for; it ranges
	  from reducing running time of an algorithm, compile time of
	  a build system, via finding cost-optimal solution to an
	  optimization problem or generating the fastest code, to
	  developing specialized tools to optimize workflows and to
	  make daily tasks more automated and less error-prone.
	<blockquote>
	  Only those who have the patience to do simple things perfectly
	  will acquire the skill to do difficult things easily.
	  ~ Johann Friedrich von Schiller
	</blockquote>
	</p>

	<p>I tend to prefer completeness and versatility, sometimes at
	  the cost of simplicity.  To that end, I admire carefully
	  developed software such as Git and Emacs.
	  <br/>
	  Similarly, I believe that thoroughness and persistence
	  eventually pays off, and I dare to continuously
	  learn new things despite of their learning curve.

<h2 id="bio">Bio</h2>

<p>I am a PhD candidate at Purdue University, interested in programming
languages and algorithms. My research focuses on improving high-level
languages, in particular object-oriented and functional ones. I have
worked on extending their type systems as well as optimizing and
understanding their run-time performance, often by exploiting advanced
type system features and customized data structures.</p>

<p>I have a strong algorithmic and software engineering background,
and am an advocate of reproducible research via open-source tools.
Among my earliest accomplishments are awards at national and
international competitions in computer programming such
as <a href="https://www.topcoder.com/community/competitive-programming/">TopCoder</a>
and American Computer Science League, during which algorithmic
problems are solved in limited time and memory.  More recently, I had
the honor to receive the Distinguished Artifact Award for the paper
"Gentrification Gone too Far? Affordable 2nd-Class Values for Fun and
(Co-)Effect", published by the ACM in the OOPSLA'16 proceedings.</p>

<p>Outside academia, I have enhanced infrastructure and tools as an
intern at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-osvald-114ba755/#experience"><u>Facebook</u></a> and
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-osvald-114ba755/#experience"><u>Yelp</u></a>,
and developed a scalable and robust algorithm for enhancing aerial images at
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/leo-osvald-114ba755/#experience"><u>Google</u></a>.
In addition to
computer vision, distributed systems and networking, I have also
worked on constrained optimization problems.</p>

<p>My passion is applying novel (meta)programming techniques and ideas to
develop elegant yet practical tools and libraries, which I release as
open-source on GitHub when they become mature.</p>
